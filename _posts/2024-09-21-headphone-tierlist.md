## Why Headphones

I like music (of almost all genres). Hence, over time I've developed a liking for one of the mediums of music, headphones :slightly_smiling_face:. Some people call this sickness being an audiophile. I prefer open-back headphones, and most open-back headphones tend to be wired and over-ear. I run most of my headphones through the iFi Zen Air CAN headphone amplifier, or through the Qudelix 5K if I'm mobile.

I like planar magnetic headphones over dynamic. I prefer headphones that are mostly flat but slightly warm, meaning a slight boost from 200-500kHz. I also prefer a slight dip around 1.5-2kHz, which help to reduce the harshness a bit and emphasize the lower mids. Other than that I prefer my treble flat. Anything too much around 3-4kHz and 8-9kHz is annoying to me (I really hate the DT770 Pro). If a pair of headphones deviate too much from this, I use parametric EQs to fix it, such as Peace Equalizer APO on PC or the Qudelix 5K on mobile.

This post helps me keep track of all the headphones I've sampled. Maybe I'll end up writing some headphone reviews in the future too, who knows.
