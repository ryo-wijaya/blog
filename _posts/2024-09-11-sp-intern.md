  A brief overview of my software engineering internship working with electric vehicle charging infrastructure at SP Group that I undertook during my 3rd of university during the semester (Jan 2023). Unfortunately, I'm writing this a little over a year too late so my memory might not be all there.

## Introduction

SP Group was a company that I applied to for a 6-month internship as part of NUS's <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/industry/intern/student/atap/" target="_blank">Advanced Technology Attachment Programme (ATAP)</a>. This internship took place during my university's 3rd year school semester, so I did some night classes concurrently for some school modules. I applied for the Product Engineering Intern role in the **electric vehicle (EV)** **Charging Station Management System (CSMS)** team. What stood out to me with regards to this internship was how nice my team was. I bonded with my internship supervisor over anime, exchanged doggo pictures with my PM, and even composed 3-4 songs together with a songwriter colleague to enter them in competitions. I rate this internship 10/10 :+1:.

## About SP Digital

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-power-ltd/" target="_blank">SP Group (Singapore Power)</a> is a government-owned utilities provider in Singapore, and is the sole electrical and gas grid operator in the country. I was posted to <a href="https://www.spdigital.sg/" target="_blank">SP Digital</a>, the EnergyTech branch of the company focused on digital transformation and driving innovation in energy management, sustainability, and smart grid technologies. Unlike it's parent organization, SP Digital was described to me as having a more start-up-like culture, flatter organizational structure, faster-paced work, and a more collaborative atmosphere geared towards problem-solving in the tech space.

Core business activities include renewable energy integration, carbon footprint tracking, smart building management and EV charging infrastructure. These involve leveraging IoT development, cloud-based analytics, smart optimization algorithms, as well as managing demand-response real-time systems. For the EV CSMS team that I joined, the main challenge was optimizing service availability, load balancing, and fleet management.
