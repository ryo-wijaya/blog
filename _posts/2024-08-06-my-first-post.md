## My Engineering Space

Over time, I realized the need for a dedicated space where I could consolidate the technical knowledge I've gained throughout my software engineering journey. Having a central hub for my personal technical documentation will be useful in helping me reflect on my growth, serve as a practical resource to revisit key concepts, and improve my technical writing skills.

This blog runs on Jekyll, Liquid templates for layouts, and GitHub Actions and Pages for deployment and hosting. It utilizes the open-source **Chirpy Jekyll Theme**.

## Content

By documenting the following insights, I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource for myself to look back on.

#### 1. Engineering Journal

I plan to document my personal journey as a software engineer in a journal format, reflecting on challenges at work on a sprint-by-sprint basis. This will hopefully save me some time when facing similar problems in the future.

#### 2. Technical Deep Dives

I plan to document a range of software development topicsâ€”everything from design patterns and architectural concepts to my understanding of good coding practices and software engineering processes. This should force me to learn via research.

#### 3. Core Computing Concepts

I plan to document foundational computing principles such as data structures, algorithms, networking, and operating system design, which are core to any engineerâ€™s toolkit. If I don't have something back to refer to, all of these will slowly vacate my hippocampus ðŸ¤¡.
