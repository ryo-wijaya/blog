### Jira Tickets

1. **Migrate Tool's Logic to Backend Repo**
  - The current functions of the tools, namely excel column header validation, S3 bucket upload, PostgreSQL table upload, are called by Spring Controllers to populate the Thymeleaf UI model. All of these should be moved to a new service that would be in charge of the project's backend functions, and the Controllers are to be converted to REST Controllers.

2. **Design and Implement new Configurable Functional Validations**
  - Turns out there are new functional requirements introduced for this tool. New validations to be added include Mandatory (for cells in a column), Uniqueness (for cells in a column), and Composite Uniqueness (for cells both in a column and across multiple columns).

---

### Main Activities

- **Code Migration**: Moved and refactored code meant to be used in the MVC pattern (with Thymeleaf) to another backend service repository, converting Spring Controllers to REST Controllers. 
- **Setup Deployment for new Backend Project**: Ensure the RESTful web service for the new backend project is up and available to access on Kubernetes pods.
- **Integrate Old Frontend with new Backend**: Ensure that the old Thymeleaf frontend can call REST APIs from the new backend without issues.
- **New Validation Classes**: Implemented Java classes for Excel data validation (mandatory, uniqueness, composite-uniqueness). These validations are designed to be configured via a PostgreSQL DB. The tool should allow for the conditional validation of data from Excel without code development, only database configurations. The data will finally be populated into S3 and selected PostgreSQL tables, which is already configured via database configurations.
- **Fell Sick**
- **Demo**: To team.

### Key Challenges/Blockers

- **Lots of Refactoring**: Since the project started as a Spring Web MVC project with Thymeleaf, Excel sheet data was encapsulated in a data transfer class and passed around by setting attributes in the model. Unfortunately, since backend logic is to be moved to a separate service, this design has to be changed. This is because `org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel`, the Java library used for manipulating Excel sheet data, contains classes that are not serializable.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Overall Familiarity with Java Development**: This includes the development of web services, getting more familiar with Spring Boot and JUnit testing, and trying to implement good interface design (ISP, SRP, and Spring DI).
