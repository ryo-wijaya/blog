## Why?

The idea actually came from a colleague in my team during my internship at SP Group, who&apos;s a hobbyist singer-songwriter. She thought that it'd be fun to collaborate on a few songs and send them off to local music competitions. Coincidentally I like music and play a few instruments so why not.

## Equipment Used

**Hardware**

- **Electric Guitars**: Squier Classic Vibe 50s Stratocaster, Sterling JP150 John Petrucci Signature
- **Acoustic Guitar**: Yamaha FG800 Acoustic Guitar
- **Piano**: Roland FP-30X
- **MIDI Controller**: Nektar SE25
- **Audio Interface**: Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Generation

**Software**

- **Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)**: Reaper
- **Plugins**: Archetype Tim Henson by Neural DSP, LABS free products, Pianoteq 8, Keyzone Clasic, MT Power Drum kit

## Pieces

### Song 1: 悲剧信徒

My first time messing around with Reaper and guitar plugins. Lyrics and singing by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soda.lyrics/" target="_blank">Neo Ee Leng</a>. I learned that even free drum plugins can sounds pretty good somehow.

**With Guitar Lead Tone**

### Song 2: 后天爱上你

Made with pretty much only an electric guitar, but at this point I've been experimenting with random audio plugins and effects. Singing/Lyrics credits: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soda.lyrics/" target="_blank">Ee Leng</a>.

### Song 3: 3 Button Face

This song is about how my naughty my dog is :rage:. Fun fact: It's called 3 Button Face because my dog has 3 buttons on her face (eyes and snout). Singing credits: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soda.lyrics/" target="_blank">Ee Leng</a>.

**With Guitar Lead Tone**

### Song 4: Jellyfish

The idea was that its supposed to have some sort of chill SpongeBob-like vibe 🤡. This one has no lyrics or singing sadly, so it's just gonna be the guitar lead tone.

### Song 5: Set Your Heart Ablaze

This one is supposed to be some sort of instrumental rock-metal piece. Was excited when I finished with it until I realized the main riff sounds like a copy of Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes 🗿, but oh whale. I also brought in my guitar-wizard Marty Friedman reincarnate friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@legovidz1/videos" target="_blank">Tim Ng</a> who created the shreddy ending solo.
