## My Engineering Space

Over time, I realized the need for a dedicated space where I could consolidate the technical knowledge I've gained throughout my software engineering journey. Having a central hub for my personal technical documentation will be useful in helping me reflect on my growth and also serve as a practical resource to revisit key concepts.

This blog runs on Jekyll, Liquid templates for layouts, and GitHub Actions and Pages for deployment and hosting. It utilizes the open-source **Chirpy Jekyll Theme**.

## Content

By documenting the following insights, I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource for both myself and others :)

#### 1. Engineering Journal

I plan to document my personal journey as a software engineer in a journal format, reflecting on week-to-week challenges.

#### 2. Technical Deep Dives

I plan to document a range of software development topics—everything from design patterns and architectural concepts to my understanding of good coding practices and software engineering processes.

#### 3. Core Computing Concepts

I plan to document foundational computing principles such as data structures, algorithms, networking, and operating system design, which are core to any engineer’s toolkit.
