## Headphones & IEMs

I prefer open-back headphones, and most open-back headphones tend to be wired and over-ear. I run most of my headphones through the iFi Zen Air CAN headphone amplifier, or through the Qudelix 5K if I'm mobile. For EQ I use parametric EQs such as Peace Equalizer APO on PC or the Qudelix 5K on mobile.

Preference:

- Mostly flat frequency response, slightly warm or dark is ok, but not the other way round
- Low mid boost (200-500Hz) is good
- Slight dip or slight peak at 1.5-2kHz is fine, both sound different and good to me
- Peak at 3-4kHz or 6-8kHz is bad
