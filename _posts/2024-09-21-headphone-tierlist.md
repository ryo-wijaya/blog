## Why Headphones

I like music (of almost all genres). Hence, over time I've developed a liking for one of the mediums of music, headphones :slightly_smiling_face:. Some people call this sickness being an audiophile. I prefer open-back headphones, and most open-back headphones tend to be wired and over-ear. I run most of my headphones through the iFi Zen Air CAN headphone amplifier, or through the Qudelix 5K if I'm mobile.

I like planar magnetic headphones over dynamic. I prefer headphones that are mostly flat but slightly warm, meaning a slight boost from 200-500kHz. I also prefer a slight dip around 1.5-2kHz, which help to reduce the harshness a bit and emphasize the lower mids. Other than that I prefer my treble flat. Anything too much around 3-4kHz and 8-9kHz is annoying to me (I really hate the DT770 Pro). If a pair of headphones deviate too much from this, I use parametric EQs to fix it, such as Peace Equalizer APO on PC or the Qudelix 5K on mobile.
