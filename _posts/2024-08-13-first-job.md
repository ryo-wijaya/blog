## About the Company

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9dit_Agricole/" target="_blank">Crédit Agricole</a> is the 10th largest bank in the world and the 3rd largest in Europe by AUM. Their products and services include capital markets, wealth management, investment banking, structured financing, commercial banking and international trade.

<a href="https://www.ca-cib.com/en" target="_blank">Crédit Agricole CIB (CACIB)</a> is the Corporate & Investment Banking arm of the Crédit Agricole Group. Globally, CACIB operates in over 30 countries, providing support for major corporations and institutional clients. It also leads in sustainable finance and green bonds. CACIB has 3 main IT hubs: Singapore, Paris, and London. Singapore is their second largest IT hub location, housing over 1400 people.

## My Onboarding Experience

As part of the Crédit Agricole CIB Graduate "Propeller" Programme, I'm to undergo 12 weeks of training, consisting of 2 weeks of SWE fundamentals refresher training and 10 weeks of specialized on-the-job training in the team's tech stack. The 2 weeks of refresher training includes Linux basics, Web basics (HTML, JS, CSS), a deep-dive into databases (SQL/PGSQL, MongoDB, data infrastructure technologies), Java programming (Spring, JPA, Servlets and JSP), Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure CI/CD.

## My Project and Team

In an environment full of mature projects, somehow I have the opportunity to join a greenfield project that aims to reinvent how data is transported, processed, and distributed from upstream sources, such as Financing, Capital Markets, and others. The goal is to serve as the single-source of truth for data needed by downstream Finance and Risk processes. When I joined, the team has just exited the POC stage and started their first sprint.

Technologies I would be touching include:

- Core Java
- Spring Boot
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Iceberg
- Angular
- Docker & Kubernetes
- SQL
- GitLab

This is quite different from the technologies that I'm used to working with (I mostly did web development during my internships). Luckily enough, I joined a team full of nice people, with a diverse background in Core Java, large-scale data processing, data engineering, and CI/CD.

Moving forward, I will be documenting what I learned on the job here, most likely on a sprint-by-sprint basis (biweekly). I'll also probably be documenting cheat sheets of the technologies/concepts that I'll be working with, mostly just so I have a place hosted online to refer back to for stuff.
