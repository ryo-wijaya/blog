Welcome to my engineering space! I’m Ryo, a software engineer passionate about building efficient solutions and exploring new technologies. I believe that being a good developer doesn't necessarily mean knowing everything, but rather knowing what to search for, how to ask the right questions, and how to derive the best solutions. Outside of work, I'm an amateur electric guitar, piano, and drums player, as well as a hobbyist composer. I also have a cute doggo.

## Current Journey

I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/national-university-of-singapore/" target="_blank">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a> with a **Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems (Honours with Distinction)**, specializing in Financial Technology. I'm currently working in my first full-time Software Engineering role at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/credit-agricole-cib/mycompany/" target="_blank">Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank</a>, focusing on finance and risk. Before this, I gained experience through internships at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-power-ltd/" target="_blank">SP Group</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/reluvate/" target="_blank">Reluvate Technologies</a>, primarily in full-stack web development.
