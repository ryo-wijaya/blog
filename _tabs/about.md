Welcome to my engineering space! I‚Äôm Ryo Wijaya, a software engineer who likes engineering software :open_mouth:. I believe that being a good developer doesn't necessarily mean knowing everything, but rather knowing what to search for, how to ask the right questions, and being passionate about the work.

Outside of work, I'm an amateur electric guitar :guitar:, keyboard :musical_keyboard:, and drums ü•Å player, as well as a hobbyist composer :computer:. I collect and have an addiction to open-back over-ear headphones :headphones:, and I also have a cute doggo :dog:.

## Current Journey

I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/national-university-of-singapore/" target="_blank">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a> with a **Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems (Honours with Distinction)**, specializing in Financial Technology. I'm currently working in my first full-time Software Engineering role at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/credit-agricole-cib/mycompany/" target="_blank">Cr√©dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank</a>, in the domain of finance and risk. Before this, I gained experience through internships at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-power-ltd/" target="_blank">SP Group</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/reluvate/" target="_blank">Reluvate Technologies</a>, primarily in full-stack web development.
