### Jira Tickets

1. **Migrate Tool's Logic to Backend Repo (con't)**
  - Sonarqube code quality fixes and unit tests.

2. **New Consistency Validator**
  - Configured separately with a comma-separated list of strings. Excel columns configured with this validation can only have row data containing one of these list values, otherwise the sheet validation will fail.

3. **New Regex Validator**
  - Configured separately with a regex pattern. Excel columns configured with this validation can only have row data that matches the configured regex pattern, otherwise the sheet validation will fail.

---

### Main Activities

- **New Validator Class - Consistency**
- **New Validator Class - Regex**
- **New Liquibase Changesets**: For functional database tables related to my tickets.
- **Code Quality Fixes**: As the project must now be scanned by Sonarqube, bugs, vulnerabilities, and code coverage must be brought up to standard.
- **Unit Tests**: From 0% (due to no previous requirement for unit testing internal utility tools).

---

### Key Challenges/Blockers

- **Wrestling with Sonarqube**: Spent some time fixing code smells and vulnerabilities. 
- **Wrestling with Unit Tests**: JUnit testing makes me want to end myself.
- **Wrestling with Liquibase**: First time using Liquibase as a database migration tool, and I ran into checksum validation problems and some other issues.
---

### Learning Outcomes

- **Overall Familiarity with Java Development**: Fixing Sonarqube issues for Java code helped me familiarize myself with things to watch out for, such as using try-with-resources blocks (for AutoClosable resources) instead of manually managing resources, or overly-complex logic flows (not enough abstraction) etc.
- **Learning to use Liquibase**: Learning how Liquibase can be used to manage database migrations, versioning, and rollbacks via code (can be source-controlled), as well as how it can be automated in the CI/CD pipeline.
